💖 Mali & Me — A Creative Anniversary Website

A React + Three.js Experience Built With Love

🌸 Overview

This project is a creative, interactive website built using React, Three.js, and custom CSS animations.
It was designed not as a school assignment or a technical demo, but as a digital celebration of love—a gift for my girlfriend, Mali, in honor of our anniversary.

Every page, animation, transition, and design choice is a reflection of our memories together.

💞 Purpose

This project was made to:

✨ Celebrate our anniversary
✨ Capture our story through visuals and creative design
✨ Build a digital timeline of our journey
✨ Share meaningful moments, photos, and videos
✨ Create something personal with heart, time, and code

Instead of buying something, I wanted to make something—something that could grow, be added to, and be visited again in the future.

This project is dedicated to Mali,

This site is one way I can hold them all."

Happy Anniversary ❤️
